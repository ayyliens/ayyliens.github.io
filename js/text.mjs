We are excited to announce that we are working on explore GPT-4 to build complete software systems, websites and mobile apps, not just small code snippets.

To accomplish this, we will develop prompts to guide GPT-4 through the entire software development lifecycle, including:

- Design and requirements analysis
- Coding the system
- Testing and debugging
- Deployment
- Ongoing maintenance and support

We will also build feedback loops and automatic correction systems to enable GPT-4 to improve its own work over time based on feedback. Our goal is for GPT-4 to be able to develop and maintain complex software systems with limited human involvement. We believe this could significantly accelerate software development and allow humans to focus on more creative and strategic work.

We will keep the community updated on our progress and hope to share examples of systems developed by GPT-4 in the coming months. Please share any feedback or suggestions you may have. We aim to build GPT-4's capabilities with the help of the community.

We cordially invite you to join us on our journey. We would greatly appreciate any assistance in discussing ideas, making attempts, writing code, or providing financial support.
