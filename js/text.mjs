We would like to use GPT4 abilities to write complex systems not only small pieces of code. To do that we've gonna build all necessary prompts from making design and requirements, to develop code and tests and deploy and maintain. Make support systems to maintain feedback loop and fix and improve systems by GPT4 capabilities automatically.

We are excited to announce that we are working on explore GPT-4 to build complete software systems, websites and mobile apps, not just small code snippets.

To accomplish this, we will develop prompts to guide GPT-4 through the entire software development lifecycle, including:

- Design and requirements analysis
- Coding the system
- Testing and debugging
- Deployment
- Ongoing maintenance and support

We will also build feedback loops and automatic correction systems to enable GPT-4 to improve its own work over time based on feedback. Our goal is for GPT-4 to be able to develop and maintain complex software systems with limited human involvement. We believe this could significantly accelerate software development and allow humans to focus on more creative and strategic work.

We will keep the community updated on our progress and hope to share examples of systems developed by GPT-4 in the coming months. Please share any feedback or suggestions you may have. We aim to build GPT-4's capabilities with the help of the community.

We cordially invite you to join us on our journey. We would greatly appreciate any assistance in discussing ideas, making attempts, writing code, or providing financial support.

## Who we are

We are a team of dedicated professional developers who have spent the majority of our lives building high-quality, intricate web and mobile applications.

We are dedicated to acting honestly and openly and avoid marketing bullshit and hype.

Our priorities include enhancing the quality of life, fostering strong relationships, and maintaining exceptional code quality. We are deeply enthusiastic about the role of AI in shaping the future and are committed to contributing our efforts to fill in the gaps as quickly as possible.

Presently, the capabilities of GPT-4 are nothing short of astounding, and we are eager to integrate it into our programming endeavors, imparting our extensive knowledge and expertise in the process.

If by chance our envisioned project already exists or you know of similar resources, please don't hesitate to share that information with us. Your guidance could save us valuable time and help us focus our efforts more effectively.

## Join us

Even if you just show interest in our work and observe, this is already a help! It is important for us to know that we are not alone.

If you can get involved, share ideas, do something of value, welcome, we'd love it!

If you can code, pull requests, find and share how to write quality code with GPT4 and other AIs, great!

If you can provide us with all possible financial support, we will be eternally grateful. At the moment we are employed and can only work on this project part of the time.

We also really need any help to build a community.
